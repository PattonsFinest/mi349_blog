            <h3>Enough to MEAD the Neady</h3>

            <p>I had first gotten into brewing through a late night youtube rabbit hole. Eventually, in my restless wanderings, I came across a channel devoted to making homemade alcohol. 
            They made a variety of beverages, but they focused on making different types of mead. Mead is a type of wine made from fermented honey. It is also among one of the oldest 
            alcoholic beverages made by humans. So after watching their videos for a month, I knew I wanted to try it out myself. So I asked Santa for the tools and equipment I needed, acquired
            some honey from a local connection, and got my yeast from a brewing store. You can make mead with nothing more than honey water and yeast, but I wanted to make something a little more interesting 
            on the pallet. I brewed a black tea with sliced grapes and orange peels mixed in. This was to add more body or “mouth feel” to the drink. I then mixed the ingredients in the 
            fermentation jug, added the yeast, and set an airlock to keep out bugs. I boldly set the jug in my closet next to my clothes, not knowing if it would explode or not. 
            Luckily, the brew stayed where it was supposed to for the 4 weeks it was fermenting. Once fermentation stopped I measured the ABV, which came out to around 8%. It came out sweet with 
            a little hint of citrus. I then bottled it and gave it out to my friends and family to be my lab rats… I mean taste testers. As far as first brews go, mine wasn’t that bad! I learned a lot 
            about the fermentation process, and got some insights into how I would do things differently next time.</p>

            <h3>Lips Like Cherry Wine</h3>
            <address class="author">Grant Sheridan</address>
            <time datetime="2021-06-03" title="June 3rd, 2021">June 3rd, 2021</time>
            <p><img src="cherry.png" alt="Cherry wine sitting in bottles"></p>
            <p>After enjoying my previous brew for about a month or so, I decided that I needed to make another. The one issue I had with this was the fact that I had no more honey to make mead
            out of. My supplier was out for the season and all other sources were nowhere near the price they offered. So, with a sunken heart, I put my brewing asparations on the shelf and
            went to the grocery store. However, while I was there I noticed an interesting beverage selection being sold. They had cherry juice from a company in Traverse City for sale. 
            As soon as I saw it the gears began to turn in my head and I quickly came up with an idea for a new brew. I bought about a gallon of the stuff and took it home to start my new brew,
            cherry wine. This fermentation ended up being a bit different from my last. I followed the same set of procedures, but had to add quite a bit of sugar to get to my target ABV of 10%.
            I also used a yeast nutrient to see how it affected fermentation. Well, there must have been something good in it because this brew fermented in half the time the last one did. Ive
            since bottled it and taken taste samples for myself. Its quite rich in mouthfeel, and has a sort of sour aftertast to it. I haven't been able to serve it to other people yet, But I 
            plan on giving a bottle of it to my friend as a wedding gift. If it sits barely touched for years, well, at least I can tell myself that they're keeping it as a memento.</p>
