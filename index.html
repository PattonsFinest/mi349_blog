            <h3>Enough to MEAD the Neady</h3>

            <p>I had first gotten into brewing through a late night youtube rabbit hole. Eventually, in my restless wanderings, I came across a channel devoted to making homemade alcohol. 
            They made a variety of beverages, but they focused on making different types of mead. Mead is a type of wine made from fermented honey. It is also among one of the oldest 
            alcoholic beverages made by humans. So after watching their videos for a month, I knew I wanted to try it out myself. So I asked Santa for the tools and equipment I needed, acquired
            some honey from a local connection, and got my yeast from a brewing store. You can make mead with nothing more than honey water and yeast, but I wanted to make something a little more interesting 
            on the pallet. I brewed a black tea with sliced grapes and orange peels mixed in. This was to add more body or “mouth feel” to the drink. I then mixed the ingredients in the 
            fermentation jug, added the yeast, and set an airlock to keep out bugs. I boldly set the jug in my closet next to my clothes, not knowing if it would explode or not. 
            Luckily, the brew stayed where it was supposed to for the 4 weeks it was fermenting. Once fermentation stopped I measured the ABV, which came out to around 8%. It came out sweet with 
            a little hint of citrus. I then bottled it and gave it out to my friends and family to be my lab rats… I mean taste testers. As far as first brews go, mine wasn’t that bad! I learned a lot 
            about the fermentation process, and got some insights into how I would do things differently next time.</p>
