        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>AAAHHHHH! Someone help me please! I've trapped myself inside this website and I don't know how to get out!!!!! That was just a joke, I havent uploaded my consciousness 
        (yet). As you can tell I am a bit of a jokster, but thats not my only defing feature. I am currently 22 years old and attend Michigan State University (GO GREEN!). Growing
        up I was always interested in technology. I liked to see how things were made, how they were opperated, and how I could use them. So at school I am studying Information Science
        with an minor in IT. In short, I am a big computer nerd. but I am also just a regular nerd too. I like watching Star Wars, playing Magic the Gathering, and reading sci-fi novels.</p>
        <p>Here are some other cool facts about me:</p>
        <ul class="fun-facts">

            <li>I have 20:80 vision</li>
            <li>I have a signed photo of "Weird Al" Yankovik</li>
